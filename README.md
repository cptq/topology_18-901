Select answers to the problem sets given in the [MIT OCW](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/mathematics/18-901-introduction-to-topology-fall-2004/index.htm) version of the course *Introduction to Topology: 18.901.* For the most part, I only try to skip tedious problems. Note that this is still a work in progress---there are still problems that I have to add.

Feel free to contact me with any issues, questions, or requests.
